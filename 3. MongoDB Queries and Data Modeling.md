# MongoDB Queries and Data Modeling

## Introduction

In this section, we will dive into MongoDB queries and data modeling. Unlike SQL, MongoDB uses a different approach for querying and manipulating data due to its flexible, schema-less nature. We will learn how to perform basic operations, filter data, and even perform complex aggregations using MongoDB's powerful query system.

## 1. Basic Query Operations

- "Let’s start with some basic query operations in MongoDB. These are similar to what you may already be familiar with in SQL but adapted for MongoDB’s NoSQL structure."

- **Finding Documents Using Simple Queries**:
  - "In MongoDB, we use the `find()` method to query documents from a collection."
  - "The basic syntax is: `db.collection.find(query)`. If no query is provided, it returns all documents in the collection."

  **Example**:
  - "Let’s assume we have a collection named `users` with documents like this:
    ```json
    { "_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York" }
    { "_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "age": 30, "city": "Chicago" }
    { "_id": 3, "name": "Charlie", "age": 35, "city": "San Francisco" }
    ```
  - "To find all users in the collection, we can use:
    ```js
    db.users.find()
    ```

- **Filtering Data with Query Operators**:
  - "To filter the data, we use query operators inside the `find()` method. These operators allow you to perform conditional checks on the document fields."
  - **Comparison Operators**:
    - `$eq` (equal), `$gt` (greater than), `$lt` (less than), `$gte` (greater than or equal), `$lte` (less than or equal), etc.
    - **Example**: Find all users who are older than 30:
      ```js
      db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } })
      ```

  - **Logical Operators**:
    - `$and`, `$or`, `$not`, `$nor` are used for combining multiple conditions.
    - **Example**: Find users who are either from New York or older than 30:
      ```js
      db.users.find({ $or: [{ city: "New York" }, { age: { $gt: 30 } }] })
      ```

## 2. Sorting and Limiting Results

- "MongoDB allows you to sort your query results using the `sort()` method."
- "The syntax is: `db.collection.find().sort({ field: 1 })` where `1` means ascending and `-1` means descending order."

  **Example**:
  - "To get the users sorted by age in ascending order, you would use:
    ```js
    db.users.find().sort({ age: 1 })
    ```

- **Limiting Results**:
  - "If you want to limit the number of documents returned by a query, you can use the `limit()` method."
  - "For example, to get only the top 2 users by age:
    ```js
    db.users.find().sort({ age: 1 }).limit(2)
    ```

## 3. Advanced Query Techniques

- "Now, let’s look at some advanced query techniques that will allow us to perform more complex operations on our data."

- **Projection: Selecting Specific Fields**:
  - "Projection allows you to select only certain fields from the documents. This is useful when you want to limit the data returned, improving performance and focusing on only what’s needed."

  - **Example**:
    - "To only return the `name` and `age` fields from the users collection, use:
      ```js
      db.users.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1 })
      ```
    - "Here, `{ name: 1, age: 1 }` is a projection document, where `1` means include the field in the result."

- **Aggregation Pipeline: Performing Complex Data Transformations**:
  - "Aggregation is a powerful feature in MongoDB that allows you to perform complex operations on the data, such as grouping, filtering, sorting, and calculating values."

  - **Aggregation Pipeline**:
    - "MongoDB uses an aggregation pipeline, where data flows through multiple stages of operations."
    - "Each stage processes the data and passes it to the next stage."

    - **Example**:
      - "Let’s say we want to calculate the average age of users in the database. We would use the `$group` stage in the aggregation pipeline:
        ```js
        db.users.aggregate([
          { $group: { _id: null, averageAge: { $avg: "$age" } } }
        ])
        ```
      - "This groups all users (since `_id: null` groups everything together) and calculates the average of the `age` field."

    - **Common Aggregation Stages**:
      - `$match`: Filters the data, similar to `find()`.
      - `$group`: Groups data and performs calculations (e.g., sum, average).
      - `$sort`: Sorts data within the pipeline.
      - `$project`: Shapes the documents, including or excluding fields.

- **Text Search: Full-Text Search Capabilities**:
  - "MongoDB provides full-text search capabilities to query text-based data efficiently."
  - "To perform a text search, MongoDB requires a text index to be created on the fields you want to search."

  - **Creating a Text Index**:
    - "You can create a text index like this:
      ```js
      db.users.createIndex({ name: "text" })
      ```

  - **Using Text Search**:
    - "Once a text index is created, you can use the `$text` operator to perform searches."
    - "Example: To find users with the name containing 'Alice':
      ```js
      db.users.find({ $text: { $search: "Alice" } })
      ```

### Summary

To summarize, we’ve learned about some basic and advanced MongoDB queries. These include simple queries, filtering with operators, sorting and limiting results, advanced operations like projection and aggregation, and even full-text search capabilities. As MongoDB is a NoSQL database, these flexible query techniques allow us to handle complex data structures in ways that are efficient and scalable. In the next section, we’ll explore data modeling in more detail, helping you design efficient MongoDB schemas for your applications.
