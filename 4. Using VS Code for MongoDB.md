# Using VS Code for MongoDB

## Introduction

In this part, we will explore how to use **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) to interact with MongoDB. VS Code is a powerful code editor that can be enhanced with extensions, allowing us to easily manage and query MongoDB directly from the editor. We’ll cover how to set up and use these tools effectively, without requiring additional installations on your system.

---

## 1. Setting Up VS Code for MongoDB

- "**First**, let’s make sure we have the right extensions installed in VS Code. Although we can’t install any software directly in the classroom, if you have VS Code installed on your local machine, we can set it up to interact with MongoDB easily."
- **Extensions for MongoDB**:
  - "To interact with MongoDB from VS Code, we will use the **MongoDB for VS Code** extension."
  - "This extension enables us to connect to MongoDB, view collections, execute queries, and even insert or modify documents directly from VS Code."

- **Installation** (For Students with VS Code Installed Locally):
  - "To install the MongoDB extension in VS Code, follow these steps:
    1. Open **VS Code**.
    2. Go to the **Extensions** view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or using `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
    3. Search for **MongoDB for VS Code**.
    4. Click **Install** on the MongoDB extension by Microsoft.
  - "Once installed, you’ll be able to access MongoDB features directly from the VS Code interface."

## 2. Connecting to MongoDB Using VS Code

Now let’s connect to a MongoDB database. In this example, we will use a MongoDB Atlas cluster, but the process is similar for local MongoDB setups.

- **Steps to Connect**:
  1. "Click on the **MongoDB** icon in the Activity Bar, which appears after the MongoDB extension is installed."
  2. "You will be prompted to **Connect** to a MongoDB instance. If you are using MongoDB Atlas (a cloud service), you can use the connection string provided by Atlas."
  3. "To use a local MongoDB instance, enter the connection string as:
     ```text
     mongodb://localhost:27017
     ```

  4. "Once connected, you will see the available databases and collections in the **MongoDB Explorer** panel on the left."

## 3. Managing Databases and Collections in VS Code

In VS Code, once we’re connected to MongoDB, we can easily manage databases and collections.

- **Viewing Databases and Collections**:
  - "On the left panel, you will see all available databases. You can expand a database to see its collections."
  - "You can right-click on a collection to perform operations like **viewing documents**, **inserting data**, or **dropping the collection**."

- **Creating a New Database and Collection**:
  - "To create a new database, simply right-click on the MongoDB instance in the **MongoDB Explorer** and choose **Create Database**."
  - "You’ll need to provide the name of the database and the first collection inside it."

  **Example**:
  - "Let’s create a `users` collection inside a `testDB` database."

## 4. Running Queries in VS Code

One of the best features of the MongoDB extension for VS Code is the ability to run queries directly from the editor.

- **Using the MongoDB Playgrounds**:
  - "VS Code allows us to write and execute MongoDB queries in **Playgrounds**. This is a great tool for writing and testing MongoDB queries, much like running SQL queries in a SQL editor."

  - **Steps to Create a Playground**:
    1. "Click on the **MongoDB** icon in the Activity Bar."
    2. "Click on **Create New Playground**."
    3. "Choose the connected MongoDB instance."
    4. "Now, you can start writing MongoDB queries in the Playground."

- **Running Simple Queries**:
  - "In the Playground, write a simple `find()` query like:
    ```js
    db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 30 } })
    ```
  - "You can run the query by pressing **`Ctrl+Shift+P`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd+Shift+P`** (Mac), then selecting **MongoDB: Run Query**."

---

## 5. Using MongoDB Snippets in VS Code

VS Code also supports **snippets**, which are predefined code templates that help speed up query writing. For MongoDB, you can use the MongoDB Snippets extension to easily insert common queries and MongoDB operations.

- **Setting Up MongoDB Snippets**:
  - "Search for the **MongoDB Snippets** extension in VS Code’s Extensions marketplace and install it."
  - "Once installed, you can type a query, such as `find()`, and hit **Tab** to expand it into a full query template."

- **Common MongoDB Snippets**:
  - **Insert Document**:
    - Type `insert` and hit **Tab** to create an insert query template.
    - Example:
      ```js
      db.collection.insertOne({
        name: "Alice",
        age: 30,
        city: "New York"
      })
      ```

  - **Update Document**:
    - Type `update` and hit **Tab** to create an update query template.
    - Example:
      ```js
      db.collection.updateOne({ _id: 1 }, { $set: { age: 31 } })
      ```

## 6. Additional MongoDB Features in VS Code

Beyond querying and managing data, VS Code also lets us perform more advanced tasks like creating indexes, using aggregation pipelines, and even visualizing data.

- **Creating Indexes**:
  - "In the MongoDB Explorer, you can right-click on a collection and select **Create Index**."
  - "MongoDB allows you to create indexes for specific fields to optimize queries. You can create a **single-field index** or a **compound index**."

- **Aggregation Pipelines**:
  - "If you need to perform more complex queries or data transformations, the Playground allows you to write aggregation pipelines."
  - "For example, you could calculate the average age of users using the `$avg` operator in an aggregation pipeline."

## 7. MongoDB Playground Exercise

In this exercise, you will learn how to run basic MongoDB queries using the **Playground** in Visual Studio Code.

### Prerequisites

1. **Visual Studio Code** installed on your system.
2. The **MongoDB for VS Code** extension installed.
3. Access to a MongoDB database (either local MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas).

### Create a MongoDB Playground

1. **Open VS Code** and make sure the **MongoDB for VS Code** extension is installed.
   - If not installed, go to the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for **MongoDB for VS Code**, and install it.

2. **Open MongoDB in VS Code**:
   - Click on the **MongoDB** icon in the Activity Bar on the left side.
   - If you haven't connected to MongoDB yet, click on **"Connect to MongoDB"** and enter your connection string (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017` or the connection string from your MongoDB Atlas account).

3. **Create a New Playground**:
   - Right-click on the **MongoDB Explorer** panel (on the left) and select **Create New Playground**.
   - A new tab will open where you can write MongoDB queries.
   - This tab allows you to interact with your MongoDB instance by running JavaScript-based queries.

### Write and Execute Queries in the Playground

#### A. Insert Sample Data

- First, let's insert a document into a collection.
- In the Playground, type the following code to insert a sample user document into a collection named `users` in the `testDB` database.

  ```js
  db.users.insertOne({
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 28,
    city: "New York"
  })


#### B. Run the Insert Query

- To execute the query, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) to open the command palette.
- Type "MongoDB: Run Query" and hit Enter.
- This will insert the document into the users collection.

#### C. Verify the Insert

- To confirm the document was inserted, run the following find query in the Playground:

`db.users.find({ name: "John Doe" })`

## 8. Summary

To summarize, we’ve learned how to use VS Code with MongoDB to manage and query data efficiently. We’ve set up the MongoDB extension, connected to a MongoDB instance, managed databases and collections, run queries, and used MongoDB snippets to streamline our workflow. With these tools, you’re well-equipped to interact with MongoDB in a modern, streamlined development environment.
